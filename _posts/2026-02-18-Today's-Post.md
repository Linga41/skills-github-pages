# What a day ✨
Today was an incredible day for me. As by just doing the GitHub skills tutorial of GitHub Pages I learned a lot. And it wasn't much of the JavaScript coding I tried last year that finally got me a physical site, but simply using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. In the tutorial, we simply learned how to use Jekyll and GitHub pages to make a site, which surprised me. In 3 lessons I didn't expect to be making this, and yes, I didn't "feel prepared". I still don't feel prepared! But, maybe that's how I should learn this time around — by just... doing.
