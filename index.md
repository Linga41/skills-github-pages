title: Welcome to my 1st site!
# 🤔 What is this about?
Yes, as a young boy (as of now) learning the GitHub flow, I'm so happy to have published my **first site ever**! This is just a site made from an exercise from the [GitHub Learn](https://learn.github.com/skills) page. And I'm doing and finishing Lesson 3, GitHub pages of first day on GitHub. And that's pretty much it, I might keep or remove this page, and make my own and actual one from my Hello World repository (project folder).
## About me
Well... I guess I won't be sharing so much about myself online just yet. But to know what I'm up to, visit my [Hello World](https://github.com/Linga41/hello-world) repostiory (in progress...) to get to know more about me.
